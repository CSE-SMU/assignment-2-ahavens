# Assignment 2 Postmortem

#Aurora Havens

## How difficult was this assignment?

Extremely difficult as I struggled not really knowing what to do. I wish there was more taught on centering as that was a big
part that I did not understand. 


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

How to center things properly and that my friend is very smart.


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?

Yes I used all of the links.


## How could this assignment be improved?

Let people make sad faces if they want. 


## Any other comments?

I was able to center the eyes but was not sure what you meant by specifying between left and right. I wish there had 
been more explanation for that.
