# Assignment 2 Postmortem

#Aurora Havens

## How difficult was this assignment?

Extremely difficult as I struggled not really knowing what to do. I wish there was more taught on centering as that was a big
part that I did not understand. I could get the face centered, but when it came down to eyes and specifying things I was stuck. 
I'm a big visual and verbal learner. I work off needing to be told and shown how it works not just "here it is do with it as you please"


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

How to center things properly and that my friend is very smart.


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?

Yes I used all of the links.


## How could this assignment be improved?

Let people make sad faces if they want. And eyebrows are curved on both sides not just one side. Having one side makes them look weird. 


## Any other comments?

I was able to center the eyes but was not sure what you meant by specifying between left and right. I wish there had 
been more explanation for that.
